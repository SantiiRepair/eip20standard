## eip20standard

A package to interact with ERC20 contracts without the need to import the abi of each different contract. 

Written in Dart to simplify code and make code cleaner and neater.

This package uses the EIP20 standard for ethereum contracts. 

## This package is no longer maintained.

I no longer want to support, contribute to, or be associated with cryptocurrencies and web3. So, the package is marked as discontinued and the repository is archived.
If anyone wants to continue maintaining this package, please get in touch.

## Usage

The library was designed to be imported with a prefix, though you don't
have to if you don't want to:

```dart
import 'package:eip20standard/eip20standard.dart' as abi;
```
